  <!--
    Main entry point for loading a single $(arg model) into Gazebo, in isolation, in the
    empty world.

    A set of ros_control controllers similar to those loaded by ur_robot_driver
    will be loaded by 'control.launch' (note: *similar*, *not* identical).

    This bringup .launch file is intentionally given the same name as the one in
    the ur_robot_driver package, as it fulfills a similar role: loading the
    configuration and starting the necessary ROS nodes which in the end provide
    a ROS API to a Universal Robots $(arg model). Only in this case, instead of a real
    robot, a virtual model in Gazebo is used.

    NOTE 1: as this is not a real robot, there are limits to the faithfulness
    of the simulation. Dynamic behaviour will be different from a real robot.
    Only a subset of topics, actions and services is supported. Specifically,
    interaction with the Control Box itself is not supported, as Gazebo does not
    simulate a Control Box. This means: no Dashboard server, no URScript topic
    and no force-torque sensor among other things.

    NOTE 2: users wishing to integrate a $(arg model) with other models into a more
    complex simulation should NOT modify this file. Instead, if it would be
    desirable to reuse this file with a custom simulation, they should create a
    copy and update this copy so as to accomodate required changes.

    In those cases, treat this file as an example, showing one way how a Gazebo
    simulation for UR robots *could* be launched. It is not necessary to mimic
    this setup completely.
