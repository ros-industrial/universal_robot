These Terms and Conditions for Use of Graphical Documentation (the “T&Cs”) govern your use of graphical files and documents*, including the contents hereof, (the “Graphical Documentation”) provided or made available to you by Universal Robots A/S (“Universal Robots”) for the purposes of creating simulations, visualizations, digital representations, path planning, collision avoidance and algorithms of or for Universal Robots’ products. The T&Cs constitute a binding agreement between you and Universal Robots. By accessing, storing, copying, sharing, opening, or otherwise using or disposing of the Graphical Documentation, you acknowledge that you are bound by the T&Cs.

1. PERMITTED USE OF THE GRAPHICAL DOCUMENTATION

1.1. You may use the Graphical Documentation for the purposes of creating simulations, visualizations, digital representations, path planning, collision avoidance and algorithms of or for Universal Robots’ products, provided that your use does not constitute comparative advertising and is not otherwise unfair, disloyal, or disparaging to Universal Robots.

1.2. Hobbyists, students and/or researchers are allowed to use the Graphical Documentation to create models or similar solely for non-commercial purposes as part of their hobby, academic studies, or research. However, no one is allowed to use the Graphical Documentation to create a physical model or similar for commercial purposes, nor to create or improve a product that is capable of competing, either directly or indirectly, with any of Universal Robots’ or its affiliates’ current or future robots.

1.3. You are permitted to create a product or solution that simulates, visualizes, or digitally represents a Universal Robots product, regardless of the origin of the underlying software, and regardless of whether Universal Robots or its affiliates have released a product that competes with the underlying software. However, you may not in any way use the Graphical Documentation to create a product or solution that simulates, visualizes or represents a product that is capable of competing, either directly or indirectly, with any of Universal Robots’ or its affiliates’ current or future products without Universal Robots’ prior written permission.

1.4. You may share the Graphical Documentation or any whole or partial copies thereof with a third party (i) if and to the extent it is necessary for you to do so in order for you to engage in use permitted pursuant to this Section 1, and (ii) you provide the recipient with a copy of the T&Cs. However, you may only make the Graphical Documentation or any whole or partial copies thereof available to the public via download if it is part of a downloadable software package that includes a copy of the T&Cs. If you download a software package that includes the Graphical Documentation, your use of the Graphical Documentation will be subject to and governed by the latest version of the T&Cs, which can be found here: https://www.universal-robots.com/legal/terms-and-conditions/terms_and_conditions_for_use_of_graphical_documentation.txt , regardless of whether they are included in the software package or not.

1.4.1. You are not allowed to alter, obscure, remove or replace any copyright or other legal notices, trademarks, business names and/or logos embedded in, superimposed on, affixed to, or otherwise included in, the Graphical Documentation without Universal Robots’ prior written permission.

1.4.2. You may show the Graphical Documentation in whole or in part to a third party or the public in the course of you engaging in the use permitted pursuant to this Section 1, provided that you display any copyright notice already contained in the Graphical Documentation, cf. also Section 1.4.1.

1.4.3. You may show graphical representations of Universal Robots’ products based on the Graphical Documentation to a third party or the public in the course of you engaging in the use permitted pursuant to this Section 1, if you, to the extent possible, display the following copyright notice in connection with such use: “© 2023 Universal Robots A/S. Use hereof is subject to Universal Robots A/S’ Terms and Conditions for Use of Graphical Documentation.” If the medium that you use limits or does not support the possibility of displaying the copyright notice, you may in good faith disregard this requirement.

1.5. You may under no circumstances use the Graphical Documentation for planning, construction, maintenance, operation, or use, directly or indirectly, in nuclear power plants, missile technology, chemical or biological weapons applications or flight, navigation, or communication of aircraft or ground support equipment.

1.6. Any use of the Graphical Documentation that is not expressly permitted pursuant to this Section 1 constitutes a material breach of the T&Cs.

1.7. If your intended use of the Graphical Documentation is not permitted pursuant to the T&Cs, you may contact Universal Robots via email at legal@universal-robots.com and request a special permission to engage in your particular intended use.
